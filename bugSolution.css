The solution involves removing the `!important` declaration and properly managing CSS specificity. 

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: red; 
}

/*The .child selector is removed as it's now correctly overridden by the parent .child selector*/
```
By removing the `!important` and relying on the natural cascading order of CSS specificity, the child element within the parent will correctly inherit the red color as intended.
